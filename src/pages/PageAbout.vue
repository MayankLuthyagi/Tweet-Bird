      <p>Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in
        July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets per day.[7]
        Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world.[8] A signature
        characteristic of the service is that posts are required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters,
        which was changed to 280 characters in 2017 and removed for paid accounts in 2023.[9] The majority of tweets are produced
        by a minority of users.[10][11] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15 percent of all
        accounts) were not genuine people.[12]</p>
